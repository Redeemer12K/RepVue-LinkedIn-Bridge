# RepVue LinkedIn Bridge
A Chrome Extension built to solve the "context-switching" pain point for sales professionals.

## The Problem
Users like @JordanLoman_ on X expressed frustration over manually switching tabs between LinkedIn and RepVue to check company sales scores.

## The Solution
This extension automatically detects a company page on LinkedIn and injects a direct link to that company's RepVue data, saving time and "preserving zen."
